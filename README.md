# WebExtension: Secret Recovery Phrase Watcher

## Summary
Monitors users typing words inside webpages and if it matches words from the BIP39 recovery phrase dictionary, warn the user.

## Why
Sometimes because of a lapse of judgement or in an anxiety induced state of confusion, one might forget that sharing your Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) with anyone except yourself is a fiscally irresponsible thing to do. This extension will hopefully catch you and persuade you to reconsider your actions.

Also, some users may forget after a while the ramifications of sharing your SRP including the ability for remote agents to completely drain your funds with it. This extension serves as a light reminder of that.

## Browser Support
