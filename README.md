# WebExtension: Secret Recovery Phrase Watcher

## Summary
Monitors users typing words inside webpages and if it matches words from the BIP39 recovery phrase dictionary, warn the user.

## Why
Sometimes because of a lapse of judgement or in an anxiety induced state of confusion, one might forget that sharing your Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP) with anyone except yourself is a fiscally irresponsible thing to do. This extension will hopefully catch you and persuade you to reconsider your actions.

Also, some users may forget after a while the ramifications of sharing your SRP including the ability for remote agents to completely drain your funds with it. This extension serves as a light reminder of that.

By using intuitive iconography availed by the browser's support of Emojis, this extension hopes that even persons operating under the influence of recreational drugs would understand the meaning of ðŸ™… and ðŸ’¸ employed in the warning message.

## Browser Support
This extension works on Firefox and Chrome.

## Permissions
This extension only requires permission to view the contents of your websites.
